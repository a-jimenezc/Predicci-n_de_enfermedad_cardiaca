The data chosen was downloaded from Kaggle under the name of “Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset” and uploaded by Rashik Rahman, with 303 observations. The original dataset was collected by: 
1.	Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
2.	University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
3.	University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
4.	V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.
The features of the dataset are the following (Rashik):
Age: Age of the patient
Sex: Sex of the patient. (0 = female, 1 = male)
cp: Chest Pain type. Value 0: typical angina, Value 1: atypical angina, Value 2: non-anginal pain, Value 3: asymptomatic.
trtbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
chol: cholesterol in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl). 1 = true, 0 = false.
rest_ecg: resting electrocardiographic results. Value 0: normal, Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria.
thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
exang: exercise induced angina. 1 = yes, 0 = no
old peak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slp: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment. 0 = unsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping.
caa: number of major vessels (0-3)
thall: thalassemia. 0 = null, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = normal, 3 = reversable defect.
output: diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
0: < 50% diameter narrowing. less chance of heart disease 
1: > 50% diameter narrowing. more chance of heart disease
